medium,Could you explain why matrices help solve { x + y = 5 ; x - y = 1 }?,"They package the system as A·v=b with A=[[1,1],[1,-1]], v=[x,y]^T, b=[5,1]^T. You can then use inverse matrices or row-reduction to solve systematically: A^{-1}b → x=3, y=2.",algebra,390aa1a849d4f3dba4437060fc9c20d6cb39f82357fd3d9b5d922e5965c14324,"To solve the system of equations { x + y = 5 ; x - y = 1 }, we can use matrices. Here's how:

**Step 1: Write the equations in matrix form**

We can represent the system of equations as a matrix equation:

[ x  y ] [ x + y = 5 ] [ x - y = 1 ]

**Step 2: Create the coefficient matrix**

The coefficient matrix is a 2x2 matrix with the coefficients of x and y in the equations:

[ 1  1 ] [ x  y ]

**Step"
